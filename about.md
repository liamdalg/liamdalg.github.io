# About Me

Second Year Computer Science Student who's in love with C# and Visual Studio Code. Static typing is my friend. I'm also interested in anything related to maths and physics!

I'm not very good at finishing projects, so I made this website to encourage me to finish them and create write-ups to explain my process.
